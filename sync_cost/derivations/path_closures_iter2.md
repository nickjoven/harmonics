# Path closures — iteration 2

## What this file is

Continuation of "close paths" mode. Iteration 2 addresses four
more candidates from Region B (depth-15 connection) and Region D
(sector decoupling).

| Candidate | Source | Verdict | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Path (b)** Sub-Fibonacci depth at EW | `depth_connection_nulls.md` | **REDUCES TO Class 2 φ⁻⁸⁰** | Region B: 3 → 2 paths (b reclassified, not new mechanism) |
| **Path (d)** Anomaly-cancellation depth | same | **BLOCKED on prerequisite** | Region B: 2 → 1 path (only c remains substantive) |
| **D.2** q_2 vs q_3 prime split | `sector_decoupling_phase_a.md` | **NAIVE NULL; refined version unclear** | Region D: 3 → 2 candidates (D.2 demoted) |
| **D.3** K=1 vs K<1 regimes | same | **PROMOTED** (argument exists in `continuum_limits.md`, needs articulation) | Region D: status sharpened; D.3 closer to Phase B start |

After this iteration: Region B narrows to {Path (c)} as the only
substantive open path. Region D narrows to {D.1, D.3-articulate}.

## Closure 5 — Path (b): Sub-Fibonacci depth at EW

### Hypothesis

φ²-depths of EW observables (`log_{φ²}(observable)`) cluster at
framework integers, giving a structural depth count for v_EW.

### What's in the framework

`anchor_count_audit.md` already records:
> "In Fibonacci-φ² units: log_{φ²}(v/M_P) ≈ −39.94"

And: "φ⁻⁸⁰ = 1.91·10⁻¹⁷ → ratio 0.947 vs v/M_P (5.3% off)" —
this is the SAME object: 80 = 2·40, so φ⁻⁸⁰ = (φ²)⁻⁴⁰ which
matches the depth-40 reading.

So Path (b) IS the φ⁻⁸⁰ near-match. Already Class 2 in
`numerology_inventory.md`:
> "φ⁻⁸⁰ ≈ v/M_P (5.32% near-match) — Numerical coincidence
> only, no structural argument attached."

### Why this is a reduction, not a new closure

Path (b) was listed as "untried" in `depth_connection_nulls.md`
because the reframe of "φ²-depth clustering at framework
integers" was distinct from the bare "φ⁻⁸⁰ near-match." But
inspecting:

- Is 40 (or 80) a framework integer? No. 40 = 8·5 = K_QUARK ·
  MEDIANT, but multiple constructions; not uniquely forced. 80
  = 16·5; same issue.
- Are EW observables (v/M_P, m_H/M_P, m_W/M_P, m_t/M_P) all at
  the same φ²-depth? Approximately yes (all ~10⁻¹⁷), so all are
  near depth 40. But this is "they're all in the same range,"
  not "they cluster at a structural integer."

Path (b) reduces to the φ⁻⁸⁰ Class 2 entry without adding new
mechanism. The "depth 40" reading is the φ⁻⁸⁰ reading in
different units.

### Verdict

**REDUCES to existing Class 2 (φ⁻⁸⁰).** Not a new closure path.
Removed from `depth_connection_nulls.md` open paths.

Note: this doesn't refute path (b); it shows path (b) is ALREADY
the same Class 2 numerology, just under a different vocabulary.
Promotes to Class 4 only if the depth-40 (or 80) integer is
uniquely forced by framework structure — currently it's not.

## Closure 6 — Path (d): Anomaly-cancellation depth

### Hypothesis

The smallest depth at which framework-derived mode counts
satisfy gauge anomaly cancellation gives `d_EW = 15`. Specifically:
mode counts at depth d, evaluated against the SM's six triangle
anomaly conditions, vanish at d = 15.

### What's in the framework

`anomaly_check.py` and MANIFEST.yml's `anomaly_cancellation`
prediction: the framework derives that **SM particle content**
satisfies all six triangle anomalies. This is a Survives
prediction.

The check uses fixed SM charge assignments (Q, u_R, d_R, L, e_R
multiplets per generation). It doesn't compute charges as a
function of "depth" on the substrate.

### What Path (d) would require

For the path to be testable:

1. Derive framework's charge assignments as a function of
   z₀-stratification depth d (currently NOT in framework)
2. Compute the six anomaly sums at each d
3. Find the smallest d where they all vanish
4. Show that this d equals 15

Step 1 is the prerequisite that doesn't exist. The framework
derives SM charges from gauge structure, but doesn't have a
"depth-d charge content" formalism that varies with d.

Without step 1, the path can't even be tested.

### Verdict

**BLOCKED on prerequisite** (parallel to Path (e)). Not testable
without first constructing depth-dependent charge content.

Removed from `depth_connection_nulls.md` open paths until
substrate-derived depth-dependent charges exist.

## Closure 7 — D.2: q_2 vs q_3 prime split as sector source

### Hypothesis

Z_6 = Z_2 × Z_3 by CRT. Cosmological sector uses Z_3 factor (q_3
spatial dimensions); particle sector uses Z_2 factor (q_2 weak
SU(2)). Coprime factors → independent → decoupling.

### What's in the framework

Both q_2 and q_3 appear in BOTH sectors:

**Cosmological sector**:
- R = 6·13⁵⁴ = `q_2·q_3 · (q_2² + q_3²)⁵⁴` (uses BOTH)
- Ω partition `13:5:1/19` uses Klein-antipodal on Z_6 = Z_{q_2 q_3}
- Spatial dimension D = q_3 = 3
- |Z_6| = q_2 · q_3 = 6 (gauge multiplicity)

**Particle sector**:
- SU(2)_weak: q_2 dimension
- SU(3)_color: q_3 dimension
- Klein parity: Z_{q_2}
- Down-type factor 6 = q_2·q_3 (uses BOTH)
- Up-type factor 9 = q_3²

Both sectors use both primes in multiple roles. The prime split
isn't sectoral — it's role-functional within EACH sector.

### Why naive D.2 fails

A clean "Z_3 → cosmology, Z_2 → particle" assignment would require
the primes to play DIFFERENT roles in the two sectors (e.g., Z_3
defines cosmological structure but plays no particle role). The
framework's existing derivations show both primes are
multi-functional in both sectors — the simple sectoral split is
not in the framework.

### Refined version

A more refined split could distinguish:
- "Topological" vs "dynamical" use of each prime
- Which generator of the Klein bottle each prime ties to
- Which observation each prime directly sets

Such refinement might give cleaner sectoral assignment. But it's
not currently in the framework's derivation chain.

### Verdict

**Naive D.2 NULL.** Both primes appear multi-functionally in both
sectors. The simple "Z_3 = cosmology, Z_2 = particle" reading
fails because the framework's existing derivations contradict it.

Refined version (distinguishing roles or linking to Klein
generators) might still work but reduces to D.1 (Klein π_1
generators) — same underlying structure expressed differently.
**Demoted from independent candidate to refinement-of-D.1.**

Removed as standalone candidate from
`sector_decoupling_phase_a.md`.

## Closure 8 — D.3: K=1 vs K<1 regimes (PROMOTION)

### Hypothesis

Cosmological sector at K=1 (critical line) gives Einstein
equations; particle sector at K<1 (subcritical) gives Schrödinger
equation. This dynamical regime distinction IS the sectoral
separation.

### What's in the framework

`continuum_limits.md` Part I and Part II derive precisely this:

> Part I §1: At K = 1, the discrete Stern-Brocot self-consistency
> with q⁻² tongue widths against Farey 1/q² measure converges to
> the Kuramoto self-consistency integral → Einstein field equations.
>
> Part II §6: At K < 1 (linearized, subcritical), the same
> self-consistency reduces to the Schrödinger equation via the
> Madelung relation ℏ = 2m·D_eff.

These are TWO LIMITS of the SAME self-consistency equation. The
framework has the structural derivation already.

### Why K=1 vs K<1 forces decoupling

Phase-transition argument:

- The K=1 line is the CRITICAL LINE of the self-consistency
  equation (where tongues fill the staircase, devil's staircase
  measure → 1)
- K<1 is the SUBCRITICAL regime (incomplete locking, regular
  dynamics)
- These regimes are separated by a phase transition at K=1
- Phase transitions are NON-SMOOTH (singular behavior at K=1)
- Therefore: the cosmological (K=1) limit and the particle (K<1)
  limit are NOT SMOOTHLY CONNECTED via K-running

The non-smoothness at K=1 IS the structural separator. You can't
move smoothly from K=1 to K<1 without crossing a phase
transition. Therefore the two limits live in distinct dynamical
regimes that the framework's substrate cannot mix.

### Why this is closer to derivation than I'd thought

The continuum_limits.md derivation already supplies:

1. K=1 limit gives one continuum theory (Einstein/GR)
2. K<1 limit gives another (Schrödinger/QM)
3. The two limits use the same self-consistency equation but at
   distinct critical regimes
4. They are non-equivalent (Einstein ≠ Schrödinger)

Implicitly: this means the framework substrate produces TWO
DISTINCT THEORIES at the two K-regimes. The fact that GR and
QM are independently observable in nature corresponds to the
substrate's two critical limits being independently realized.

This is closer to a Class 4 candidate than the "open question"
status I'd assigned in Phase A.

### What's still missing for Class 5

Explicit derivation of:

1. **The phase transition at K=1 is a STRUCTURAL boundary**, not
   a dynamical one. Need to show K=1 is forced by the
   self-consistency equation's mathematical structure, not by
   coincidence.

2. **No smooth K-running connects K=1 to K<1 within the
   substrate.** Need to show that any continuous interpolation
   K(t) between the two regimes encounters singularity at K=1.
   (`continuity_in_K_nulls.md` N11 partly supports this — tongue
   coverage discontinuity at K=1 is structurally forced.)

3. **The two anchors (H_0 cosmological, v_EW particle) are
   pinned by the SCALE of each regime independently.** Need to
   show H_0 sets the K=1 regime's scale and v_EW sets the K<1
   regime's scale, with no shared scale.

Each of these is a focused derivation, ~1-2 sessions.

### Verdict

**PROMOTED.** D.3 has a structural derivation already in
`continuum_limits.md`. The phase-transition argument forces
sectoral separation. Three explicit articulations needed for
Class 5:

(a) K=1 is structural boundary, not coincidence
(b) No smooth K-running connects K=1 to K<1 (uses N11)
(c) Two anchors set scales independently

Of the three remaining D candidates, **D.3 is closest to
closure**. Phase B for D.3 = articulate (a), (b), (c) explicitly
and verify each passes Z1-Z3.

Updated `sector_decoupling_phase_a.md` candidate ranking: D.3
moves from "possibly single-session" to "Phase B ready, three
focused articulations needed."

## Updated open candidate lists after iteration 2

### Region D (sector decoupling): 3 → 1 substantive + 1 ready-to-derive

| Candidate | Status |
|---|---|
| **D.1 Klein π_1 two generators** | OPEN; multi-session structural work |
| **D.3 K=1 vs K<1 regimes** | **PROMOTED**; Phase B ready (3 articulations needed) |
| ~~D.2 q_2/q_3 prime split~~ | Demoted to refinement-of-D.1; not standalone |
| ~~D.4 Spectral gap on SB tree~~ | NULL (iter 1) |
| ~~D.5 Anomaly between sectors~~ | NULL (iter 1) |
| ~~D.6 K_eff = K_0/2 split~~ | NULL weak (iter 1) |

### Region B (depth-15 connection): 3 → 1 substantive

| Path | Status |
|---|---|
| **(c) Cross-sector tongue identification** | OPEN; substantive single-session probe |
| ~~(b) Sub-Fibonacci depth~~ | REDUCES to Class 2 φ⁻⁸⁰ (iter 2) |
| ~~(d) Anomaly-cancellation depth~~ | BLOCKED on prerequisite (iter 2) |
| ~~(e) Conformal-equivalence depth~~ | BLOCKED on prerequisite (iter 1) |

## What this iteration accomplished

**Concrete subtractions**:
- Region D: 3 → 1 substantive candidate (D.3 promoted to ready,
  D.2 demoted, D.4/D.5/D.6 closed in iter 1)
- Region B: 3 → 1 substantive path (Path (c) only)

**Methodological**:
- D.3 reframed from "open question" to "ready Phase B with 3
  explicit articulations"
- Path (b) shown to be REDUCTION to existing Class 2, not new
  mechanism
- Path (d) BLOCKED with specific prerequisite identified

**Net effect on open framework derivation list**:

After 2 iterations, the framework's substantive open
multi-session work concentrates into:

| Region | Open candidates | Status |
|---|---|---|
| C — numerology count | (Phase B = run the count) | Ready |
| D — sector decoupling | D.1 (Klein π_1, multi-session) + D.3 (K=1/K<1, ready Phase B) | One ready, one substantive |
| B — depth-15 connection | Path (c) cross-sector tongues | Single substantive probe |

Down from a much larger landscape pre-iteration.

## What this DOESN'T do

- Doesn't run any of the Phase B's
- Doesn't choose which to start
- Doesn't update `framework_status.md` (deferred — would update
  if user commits to start one)
- D.1 (Klein π_1) remains genuinely multi-session work; not
  closeable in iteration mode

## Next iteration options

The open list is now small enough that the next move is
substantive, not more closures:

1. **Begin Phase B for D.3** — three articulations are well-defined
   and can be executed in 1-3 focused sessions. Most-ready closure.

2. **Begin Phase B for Region C** (numerology count) — single
   focused enumeration; binary verdict; informs other choices.

3. **Run path (c)** — cross-sector tongue identification probe;
   single session, definite outcome.

4. **More closures** if any remain — but the open list is now
   short enough that closure mode hits diminishing returns.
