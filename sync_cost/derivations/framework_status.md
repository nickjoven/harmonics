# Framework status map

At-a-glance inventory. One line per item. Full analysis lives in the
referenced files; this is the bird's-eye view to prevent duplicate
work and re-derivation of eliminated content.

Categories:
- **Survives**: structural derivation present, closes at σ level.
- **Floor (structural)**: structural residual confirmed at finite depth.
- **Floor (numerology cloud)**: particle-sector near-matches, no structural basis.
- **Fails**: confirmed numerology with explicit disproof.
- **Eliminated**: noted coincidences or structural attempts tested null.
- **Proposed**: awaiting audit or experimental resolution.
- **Out of class**: absolute scales requiring observational anchor.

## Survives (structural, σ-closed)

| Item | Source |

| Ω_Λ = 13/19 (0.07σ), Ω_m = 6/19, Ω_DM = 5/19, Ω_b = 1/19 (single-w) | same |
| **Ω_b two-component closure (full Class 5)**: (α, β) = (0, 1), w_- = 1 from sign-rep no-EM, w_+ = 13/14 from cusp-1/2 ground state on X_0(6); zero free parameters at closure level. Predictions: Ω_b = 13/264 (0.12%), Ω_DM = 35/132 (0.06%), Ω_Λ = 181/264 (0.13%) | `omega_b_alpha_beta_closure.md`, `psl2z_subgroup_phase_b.md`, `L1_substrate_cusp_ground_state.md`, `w_plus_formalization.md` |
| Friedmann form at r = 1 — *canonically affirmed structural* (S1–S2; S3–S5 = N9, **dispositioned not-a-blocker**: continuity-in-K was the superseded-C5 dependency, no landed result needs continuous `w(z)`, residual = the era timeline, now tiered: ordering structural / schedule anchor-declined / K↔energy **now structurally closed** via the K(t) cadence closure (see row below) — see `era_timeline_disposition.md`, `continuity_in_K_nulls.md`, `k_of_t_residual_disposition.md`); affirmed alongside R, Λ·ℓ_P² | `k_of_t_friedmann.md`, `numerology_inventory.md` "What remains genuinely structural" #1 |
| **K(t) cadence = 2/57 = 2/(q₃·19_Λ)** (structural closure of the era-timeline Tier 3 / K↔energy mapping). Cadence uniquely forced by Q mod 2 mediant projection (state-axis dual of inviolable #1) + #6 structural integers + bicone-golden Z₂ identification (Galois uniqueness on ℚ[√5] extending Q-mod-2 from integer to irrational windings). Predicts **N_efolds = √5 / (2/57) ≈ 63.7**, falsifiable outside `[62, 66]` at CMB-S4 / LiteBIRD precision. SU(3) × Ω_Λ-denominator sector reading. PRs #178 (projection) + #179 (closure). | `k_of_t_residual_disposition.md`, `bicone_golden_z2_identification.md`, `q_mod2_mediant_projection.md`, `master_cascade_identity.md`, `predictions_horizon_2026.md` |
| λ_unlock = (4G − π ln 2)/π (Arnold Lyapunov on Z₂ quotient) — value airtight; derivation doc `kam_bridge_synthesis.md` was **net-rejected work** (Class-2 Pythagorean-comma recording), only this fragment salvaged | `lambda_unlock_closed_form.py` (numerical↔closed-form to 1e-15), `a_s_geometric_proof.md` A5.2 (value 0.473096), `numerology_inventory.md` §"λ_unlock = (4G − π ln 2)/π at K=1" |
| Born rule |ψ|² from saddle-node | `born_rule.md`, `a1_from_saddle_node.md` |
| a_0 = cH_0/(2π) from Λ (MOND scale) | `a0_threshold.md` |
| Z₂/winding topological-charge conservation (committed as **inviolable #1**, Klein-bottle topological rigidity; "no local process changes `Q mod 2`"). **Standalone theorem now articulated** (`q_mod2_conservation_theorem.md`): proves `Q mod 2` is preserved under any deformation of `φ` whose support fits in an antiperiodic-loop-free chart (diameter `< L_x`), and that processes changing `Q mod 2` must encircle the antiperiodic direction and are therefore non-local at the substrate's own geometric scale. | `q_mod2_conservation_theorem.md`, `substrate_determinism.md` (inviolable #1) |
| **EPR/Bell assembly theorem** (`epr_bell_assembly_theorem.md`): Born rule + `q_mod2_conservation_theorem.md` + topological non-locality of the Klein-bottle context window compose to non-signaling Bell-violating joint statistics matching QM at the Tsirelson bound; Bell's no-go does not apply because the framework is not a local hidden-variable theory — the conserved `Q_{AB} mod 2` is a global topological invariant, not a shared `λ`. Articulation, not new prediction. | `epr_bell_assembly_theorem.md` |
| **GHZ correlations from substrate** (PR #184, `ghz_from_substrate.md`): EPR/Bell pair-wise apparatus extends to 3-mode via Q_{ABC} = Q_A ⊕ Q_B ⊕ Q_C; substrate reproduces ⟨XXX⟩ = +1, ⟨XYY⟩ = ⟨YXY⟩ = ⟨YYX⟩ = −1, saturates Mermin |M| = 4 (QM bound) and violates LHV bound 2; structural-scaling claim: 3 events + 1 invariant vs 2³ tensor components. Level-3 worked example; substitution-based (substrate ↔ QM term-by-term), not independent derivation. | `ghz_from_substrate.md` |
| **W states (T1a): narrowing then Dicke extension** (`w_state_from_substrate.md`): bare Pauli-Z₂ Q-invariant underdetermines W (W lives in `Z_{ABC} = −1` subspace; only `ZZZ = −1` Pauli stabilizer — not a stabilizer state). **Dicke primitive (N, k)** closes the gap: recursive Schmidt `D(N,k) = √(k/N)·D(N−1,k−1)⊗|1⟩ + √((N−k)/N)·D(N−1,k)⊗|0⟩` derives W's correlations substrate-independently (verified D(3,1), D(4,1), D(4,2), D(4,3), D(5,2); err ~10⁻¹⁶). Refined substrate reach: (Pauli stabilizer) ∪ (Dicke) ∪ (continuous-θ single-mode) ∪ (tensor products); strict subset of classically-tractable multipartite QM; boundary numerically mapped at (\|GHZ⟩+\|W⟩)/√2 (0 stabs, non-Dicke), phase-twisted (T⊗I⊗I)\|W⟩, generic bond-dim-2 MPS, Haar-random. Discriminator-clause discipline applied to multi-mode reach; sharpens rather than weakens QM-reframing program. | `w_state_from_substrate.md` |
| **D3: Bell bounds substrate-native** (PR #188, `bell_bounds_from_substrate.md`): pair-wise correlation `E(θ_A, θ_B) = −cos(θ_A − θ_B)`, Tsirelson `\|S\|_max = 2√2`, and GHZ Mermin `\|M\|_max = 4` derived substrate-internally above the foundational complex-amplitude/Pauli/Q-conservation layer — closing the substitution scope from `epr_bell_assembly_theorem.md` (#152) Clause (a). Substitution scope reduces from "entire QM formalism in K<1 limit" to "the framework's foundational layer (Klein bottle → ℂ → SU(2) → Pauli; saddle-node → Born rule; Q-mod-2 conservation), itself substrate-derived through prior docs." Audit table separates substrate-derived components (cos formula via bilinearity + sum-angle; Tsirelson via trigonometric maximization; Mermin via Pauli algebra on stabilizer group) from foundational-layer load. Class-3 articulation; no new substrate primitive. | `bell_bounds_from_substrate.md` |
| **D1: Dicke apparatus theorem** (PR #189, `dicke_apparatus_theorem.md`): upgrades the T1a Dicke extension from observation + numerical verification to theorem-quality. For every `N ≥ 1`, every `0 ≤ k_1, k_2 ≤ N`, and every Pauli string `P`, the matrix element `⟨D(N, k_1) \| P \| D(N, k_2)⟩` is computable substrate-internally via the recursive Schmidt structure + bilinearity + single-mode Pauli matrix entries (foundational layer). Proof by strong induction on `N`; four cases per `α_N ∈ {I, z, x, y}`, with σ_x/σ_y cases handled via off-diagonal Dicke cross-terms. Corollaries: all symmetric-subspace Pauli expectations substrate-computable; `O(N²)` substrate cost per matrix element via recursion; apparatus closed under conditional projection / linear combinations / Pauli evaluation. Numerically verified across `D(3, 1), D(4, 1), D(4, 2), D(4, 3), D(5, 2)`. | `dicke_apparatus_theorem.md` |
| **D2: SNMC class + substrate-natural entanglement measures** (PR #190, `snmc_class_and_entanglement.md`): formalizes the substrate's natural multipartite QM reach as the **Substrate-Natural Multipartite Class** — tensor-product closure of (Pauli stabilizer) ∪ (Dicke states + symmetric subspace) ∪ (continuous-θ single-mode), `O(N)` substrate data per `N`-qubit state. Closure under tensor product and conditional Z-projection; **non-closure under arbitrary local unitaries** is the *signature* of SNMC's discrete-symmetry character (Clifford preserves, non-Clifford/magic generically exits — mechanism of quantum-computational advantage). Substrate-natural entanglement vocabulary for 7 standard measures (Schmidt rank, single-mode entropy, pair-wise concurrence, 3-tangle, stabilizer corank, Dicke excitation density, Q-correlation); each polynomially substrate-computable from substrate data. Headline result: single-mode entropy of `D(N, k)` is `H(k/N)` (binary entropy of excitation density), substrate-derived from token-counting. Reach is *strict subset* of classically-tractable multipartite QM. | `snmc_class_and_entanglement.md` |
| **The Discrete Extension Principle** (PR #191, `discrete_extension_principle.md`): first-class meta-principle peer to the Basepoint Principle. Elevates the multiply-verified pattern (K(t) cadence closure #179, T1a Dicke extension #187, D3 Bell bounds #188) into a discriminator-clause meta-principle: when the substrate's bare apparatus underdetermines a target (Class-2 empirical leaf, narrowing finding, substitution-scope caveat), search for a *substrate-aligned discrete combinatorial primitive* built from existing inviolables that closes the gap; if found and audit-disciplined → gap bridgeable, Class level promotes; if no such primitive exhibitable after careful search → structural boundary (e.g., SNMC boundary at non-stabilizer non-Dicke states, verified in #187 batch-2 tests). Composes with Basepoint Principle to form a binary discriminator system. Bright line: NOT a licence to expect closure-by-default; NOT a prescription forbidding continuous-parameter substrate primitives. Candidates for deliberate deployment: Salpeter slope, Cl(3, 1) anticommutation, other Class-2 leaves. Articulation, not new content. | `discrete_extension_principle.md` |
| **Two-anchor minimality** (H_0 cosmological + v_EW particle) is structural, not a derivation gap; the five anchor-count obstructions **formally re-audited** (none open): #5 rigorous/load-bearing, #1=#2 Feature (prime-5 absence), #3 argued, #4 dissolved — an instance of the Basepoint Principle | `anchor_count_reaudit.md` (formal re-audit) ← `anchor_count_audit.md`; `hierarchy_problem_translation.md`; `path_closures_iter3.md` (D.3 closes #5) |
| **K=1 ↔ K<1 sector decoupling** (Einstein vs Schrödinger continuum limits) is non-smooth, forces independent anchors per sector | `continuum_limits.md` Parts I/II; `continuity_in_K_nulls.md` N11; `path_closures_iter3.md` |
| **Klein π_1 sector assignment**: cosmological → no-twist, particle → twist; Z_2 rep machinery forces the assignment | `path_closures_iter4.md` (D.1 → Class 5) |
| **A_s = 2.33×10⁻⁹ substrate-side prediction**: framework's complete substrate-side static-variance prediction at the matter-sector pivot; the 11% gap to A_s_obs = 2.10×10⁻⁹ is the inflation amplification factor f_amp (anchor-side, depends on H_inf + ε); framework correctly declines to predict both A_s_obs and f_amp. Instance 7 closure ACCEPTED. | `a_s_geometric_proof.md`, `a_s_g1_closure_attempt.md`, `vocabulary_is_the_work_pattern.md` Instance 7 |
| **Sine-Gordon emergence at K = 1**: locked-state expansion of the framework Lagrangian gives `∂²_t φ − c² ∂²_x φ + ω₀² sin(φ) = 0` for fluctuations φ = θ − ψ around the locked mean phase, with `c² = σ²/m`, `ω₀² = K r / m`. No new primitives. | `sine_gordon_substrate.md`, building on `framework_lagrangian.py`, `einstein_from_kuramoto.md` |
| **Z₂-graded soliton charge from Klein antiperiodicity**: kink ↔ antikink under traversal of the antiperiodic spatial loop is forced by `f(x+L_x, y) = −f(x, L_y−y)`. Distinct from the field half-twist `θ → θ + π` (which gives spin-statistics). | `sine_gordon_substrate.md`, `klein_bottle.md` (Soliton sector consequence section) |
| **S_v(K=1) ≈ 11.515 (discrete 4-mode reduction, computed)**: the "real Phase 2" delivered — hand-computed, numerically verified, native discrete representation. Supersedes the assumed-symmetric `S_v = 16` (Finding 3). Diagonal direction-asymmetric (`H_BB ≈ 9.580 ≠ H_CC ≈ 3.645`, half-twist breaking sector-swap); `E_cross = −4` exact. Caveat-2 (half-twist assignment) resolved via `xor_derivation.md` §3.3 homotopy theorem. Upper bound under uniform-winding ansatz. | `discrete_reduction_computed.md` (canonical) |
| **The Basepoint Principle** (named structural principle, peer to no-rescaling / the inviolables): the framework supplies torsorial structure and never the basepoints; a declined basepoint is a structural *feature* **iff** the missing selecting section is *structurally forced* (obstruction exhibited), else it stays *open*. **Seven verified instances**: R1/∅ (Z₂-torsor, ontological root), the two ℝ₊ scale-anchors (nature/number sayable, value declined, dynamically inert by torsor-invariance), #INF, the anchor obstructions, A_s/Instance-7, and **L vs R orientation** (7th — Z₂-torsor at SM-labels-on-substrate layer; four-level obstruction including vocabulary-closure on 3×3 matter-sector matrix; empirical resolution via parity violation / Wu 1957). **Candidate 8th**: substrate surface choice (K²/T² Z₂-torsor at the surface-selection layer; substrate-internal RP² exclusion + observation-fixed K² selection from substrate-admitted pair via fermion existence + Ω_Λ match — see `surface_uniqueness_audit.md`). A consistency boundary with a discriminator — NOT a derivation, NOT a licence to classify unsolved problems as features. | `basepoint_principle.md`, `vocabulary_bridge_iteration_2_step_2.md` (7th), `surface_uniqueness_audit.md` (candidate 8th) |
| **Substrate-chirality disposition closed at path δ'** (PR #214): substrate-forces the lepton SU(2) doublet/singlet kinematic split via Mihailescu-strength forcing of `(q_2, q_3) = (2, 3)` (cube identity `q_3² − q_2³ = 1` is the Catalan equation, unique consecutive perfect powers); the L/R labeling of which sector is "L-handed" is observation-fixed via parity violation (Wu et al. 1957). Three independent layers compose to give the full disposition: (a) apparatus-extension declined by empirical floor (ℍ-QM exclusion via Frobenius closure on second antiperiodic cycle, `klein_bottle_restructure_price.md`); (b) vocabulary-bridge closed at path δ' (kinematic structure substrate-forced, labeling observation-fixed; three direct constraint checks all return "no substrate constraint on labeling"); (c) basepoint principle 7th instance (L vs R as Z₂-torsor at SM-labels-on-substrate layer). Framework correctly neither forces nor needs to derive which chirality couples to weak bosons. | `vocabulary_bridge_iteration_2_step_2.md`, `vocabulary_bridge_iteration_2_step_1.md`, `klein_bottle_restructure_price.md`, `klein_z2_decomposition_falsifier_2.md`, `mass_sector_closure.md` "Connection to the Catalan equation / Mihailescu's theorem" |
| **Mihailescu connection for substrate primitives** (PR #214): the framework's cube identity `q_3² − q_2³ = 1` is the **Catalan equation** in the specific case `(p, q) = (2, 3)`. Mihailescu's theorem (Preda Mihăilescu, 2002, *J. Reine Angew. Math.* **572**) proves the unique solution in positive integers with `p, q ≥ 2` is `(x, p, y, q) = (3, 2, 2, 3)` — i.e., 8 and 9 are the only consecutive perfect powers in positive integers. The cube identity alone (without the coupled `q_2² − 1 = q_3` identity) substrate-forces `(q_2, q_3) = (2, 3)` via Mihailescu; the second identity becomes a consistency check rather than a co-equal forcing input. The framework's substrate primitives are the **unique pair of consecutive perfect powers** — deepest available number-theoretic forcing. | `mass_sector_closure.md` "Connection to the Catalan equation / Mihailescu's theorem", `canonical_glossary.md` Section 5 |
| **Per-sector sine-Gordon reduction at K<1 (structurally forced, Class-3)**: the Goldstein–Kac construction is **K-parameterized** (its only K-dependence is `ω₀²=Kr/m`; the binary-Z₂ tick, the flip, and `c²=σ²/m` are K-independent), so it runs identically at every cascade `K_n` — discharging the former "conjectural at K<1 / working assumption". Kink-mass ratio `M_k(d,n,b)/M_k(K=1) = b^(−n/(2d))·√(r_n)`, **read as the upper bound** `≤ b^(−n/(2d))` (K-scaling Class-3 forced; `√r_n` bounded but Class-2 absent structural input — see `sqrt_r_n_correction.md` for the precise articulation, three candidate closure routes, and bright lines). The soliton-sector *observable-identification* stays Class-2, declined, not chased. | `proposed_residual_closure.md`, `sqrt_r_n_correction.md`, `tick_continuum_construction.md`; supersedes the K<1 "conjectural" flag in `sine_gordon_substrate.md` |

## Floor (structural residual at finite Fibonacci depth)

(empty after 2026-04 closure round)

| Former entry | Disposition |
|---|---|
| ~~A_s 11% / 7.7σ~~ | **Closed Instance 7**: substrate-side prediction A_s = 2.33×10⁻⁹ is complete; gap is anchor-side amplification, no framework-internal claim about magnitude. Promoted to Survives entry above. |
| ~~Ω_b 6.7%~~ | **Closed full Class 5** via two-component (sign-rep no-EM) + Γ_0(6) cusp + L1 substrate ground state. Predictions sub-σ on all three observables. Promoted to Survives. |
| ~~Ω_c / Ω_b 7.5%~~ | **Closed (inherits from Ω_b)**: 0.6% residual under two-component closure. Promoted to Survives. |

The hybrid strategy (`Ω_b = (1/19)·|r|²`, `A_s = 2.33·|r|³ × 10⁻⁹`)
matches observation ≤ 1σ for Ω_b and A_s but with different
exponents per observable, no forcing argument for either, and
`|r|` observation-derived rather than framework-native. Per
`hybrid_strategy_audit.md` it is Class 2 numerology, not a Floor
closure. **Superseded for Ω_b by the two-component closure.**

## Floor (particle numerology cloud, 1–3%)

| Item | Residual | Source |
|---|---|---|
| m_H/v = 1/q_2 = 1/2 | 1.7% (12.6σ) | `duty_cycle_dictionary.md` |
| λ_Higgs = 1/(2q_2²) = 1/8 | 3.4% | same |
| α_s/α_2 = q_3³/q_2³ = 27/8 | 3.2% | same |

Same ansatz as confirmed-numerology items below. The 1-3% floor is
numerology ensemble, not structural.

## Empirical (open, framework-noted, not derived)

Items where the framework notes a value or relation but does not
currently derive it from substrate apparatus. **Open in the
basepoint-principle sense** — operational gap, no obstruction
proven; distinct from "Fails" (confirmed numerology with disproof)
and from "Eliminated" (coincidences ruled out). Each item rests on
its own structural-consistency analysis where available; none
crosses the line into derivation. Same administrative status as
the SM's free parameters.

| Item | Observed | Framework status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Koide `K_lepton = 2/3`** | ≈ 0.6667 at running scale | Iter 13 uniqueness theorem: `M = q_3 I − q_2 J` is unique under (S_3-equivariance, Lorentzian (2,1) signature, uniform eigenvalue magnitude q_3); two constraints substrate-derived, third is the one residual structural assumption. **Iteration arc 1–13 closed as productive null at iter 14**. Exact match to independently-derived Klein-bottle ratio `Q = q_2/q_3 = 2/3` is structural coincidence or unfound correspondence — undecided. | `koide_form_substrate_iteration_14.md` (closing note); `koide_form_substrate_iteration_13.md` (uniqueness theorem) |
| **sin²θ_W (parameter)** | ≈ 0.231 at M_Z | Framework notes; no derivation attempted at the parameter level. The specific identity `sin²θ_W = 8/35` is in "Fails" below as a tested-and-failed Planck-scale numerology, but the underlying parameter remains open. | (none) |
| **`m_μ/m_e` bare-tree** | Observed: 206.77 | Framework prediction: `7^(5/2) = 129.6`. **37% gap, open.** Previous "0.96% match" in `generation_mechanism.md` §4 was a hidden empirical import of Koide constraint and is retracted. | `koide_form_substrate_iteration_14.md`; `generation_mechanism.md` §4 (now historical) |
| **PMNS θ_13** | Observed: 8.6° | Framework prediction (Fritzsch-form `arctan √(W_A/W_B)`): 28.13°. **3.3× gap, open.** Same regime as strict Fritzsch's V_cb failure; no NLO mechanism identified. Symmetric self-field NLO worsens this angle (cross-check failed). | `mixing_angle_audit.md`; `koide_form_substrate_iteration_14.md` |
| **All CKM angles** | θ_12 ≈ 13.04°, θ_23 ≈ 2.38°, θ_13 ≈ 0.20°, δ_CP ≈ 69° | Framework provides tree-level (30°, 42.79°, 28.13°); SM RG running between tree scale and EW scale orthogonal to framework. **All open at the running-mechanism level.** | `mixing_angle_audit.md`, `ckm_from_sl2z.py` |
| **Muon g−2 anomaly** | δa_μ ≈ 2.5×10⁻⁹ | No framework apparatus for anomalous magnetic moments. | (none) |

**Methodological note.** The "Empirical" category is *not* a
catch-all for unsolved problems. Items land here only when the
framework has either (a) attempted derivation and produced a
structural-consistency result short of closure, or (b) noted the
value without attempting derivation. Items where the framework has
*declined* the question via the basepoint principle's discriminator
(forced-decline with obstruction exhibited) belong in `Out of class`
or in a Survives entry citing the decline. Items that fail a
specific identity test belong in `Fails`. The discriminator
distinguishing these is the basepoint principle.

## Fails (confirmed numerology, do not use as building block)

| Item | Disproof |
|---|---|
| sin²θ_W = 8/35 | `sinW_running_check.py` (SM running rules out Planck-scale origin) |
| 1/α_em (tree) = 35 | Same analysis, same issue |

## Eliminated (coincidences or structural-attempt nulls)

| Item | Why eliminated |
|---|---|
| v/M_P ≈ 13⁻¹⁵ (3.1%) | `yukawa_mediant_cascade.py` null; `z_30_substrate_check.py` dead end |
| φ⁻⁸⁰ ≈ v/M_P (5.3%) | Numerical coincidence only |
| 1/(Pythagorean comma)² ≈ K_Greene (0.17%) | `numerology_inventory.md` §"Pythagorean comma vs K_Greene" — preserves the rejected `kam_bridge_synthesis.md` §6 recording (Class 2, no structural route; source doc never committed) |
| H_inf from framework integers | `h_inf_status.md` (scale-free reframe: out of class) |
| Mean-field Ψ Arnold-tongue structure | `klein_spectrum.py`, `kuramoto_induced_map.py` (Adler-only) |
| Twist-map / KAM / cantorus / Lyapunov framings of the ψ_F visualizer | Source inspection confirms gradient descent on a static potential; category error. Mechanism note in `klein_nodal_parity.md` |
| Klein nodal parity (odd-m Möbius vs even-m disjoint arcs at σ=+node) | `klein_nodal_parity.md`: simulator uses Y², which is Z₂-symmetric for all ℓ. The (−1)^ℓ sign flip on Y doesn't survive squaring; dynamics cannot discriminate parity. |
| λ_H = 1/q_2³ + 1/228 correction | `framework_predictions.py:268` and `numerology_inventory.md` Class 1: 1/228 confirmed fitted (not framework-derived); correction removed. Bare identity λ_H = 1/q_2³ = 1/8 remains a declined `bare_k1_identities` entry with 3.4% residual. |

## Proposed (needs audit or experimental input)

> **All three 2026-05 Proposed items dispositioned this session
> (see `proposed_items_disposition.md`, `proposed_residual_closure.md`;
> chronology: `thread_chronology.md`).** None remains an open
> framework deliverable:

| Item | Disposition |
|---|---|
| ~~K_c(F_n/F_{n+1}) closed form~~ | **Out of scope, not a framework gap.** Gap-1 K_c closed (`k_critical_phase_b.md`); framework uses `K_map = 1` *exact*. The finite-`n` Fibonacci closed-form is a known-hard *external* KAM problem the framework neither has nor needs. (Secondary: RFE branch born first-order at `K_c^RFE≈1.56`; `K_c^RFE=Σw(1)` a **flagged conjecture, not claimed**.) |
| ~~T2#7 measurement-arc residuals~~ | **Closed.** Iteration-to-time anchor = Basepoint-decline (#INF pattern); continuous-K(t) = dynamic saddle-node sweep (Born preserved, rate-independent); multi-tongue = direct collapse dominant, cascade `(K/2)^{Δq}`-suppressed. `proposed_residual_closure.md`. |
| ~~K-zoo kink-mass ratios `M_k(d,n,b)/M_k(K=1)`~~ | **Reduction promoted to Survives (Class-3, structurally forced)** — see Survives entry below. Ratio `= b^(−n/(2d))·√(r_n)` (K-scaling forced; `√r_n` an honest flagged correction). Only the *observable-identification* (which object ↔ which kink per sector) stays **Class-2, declined, not chased**. |

The Proposed tier is **empty of open framework deliverables**.
What remains is one quantitative correction (`√r_n`) and one
declined Class-2 disposition — neither an open problem.

## Out of class (absolute scales, anchor-dependent)

| Item | Anchor required |
|---|---|
| H_inf in GeV | H_0 (cosmological anchor) |
| τ_unlock(n) in seconds | H_0 |
| Reheating temperature in K | H_0 |
| Inflation-end time in seconds | H_0 |
| Absolute M_Planck in kg | H_0 |
| Tensor-to-scalar r (absolute) | H_0 + scale factor |
| Absolute lepton/quark/gauge-boson masses | v_EW (particle-sector anchor) |
| ℏ, c, G in absolute units | v_EW |

Ratios within each sector are in class (MacKay-scaling on Z₂ quotient
for cosmology; dimensionless couplings for particles). Absolute values
require **two** observational anchors — one cosmological (H_0), one
particle-sector (v_EW). Reduction to one was treated as an open
item in `anchor_count_audit.md` (five specific obstructions); per
`hierarchy_problem_translation.md` and `path_a_walkthrough.md`,
the two-anchor minimum is a **structural feature** (not a defect
to be lifted): the canonical register's prime support `{2, 3}`
cannot reach `15 = 3·5` for the `v/M_P ≈ 13⁻¹⁵` target, and the
SM hierarchy problem (the imported framing under which "two
anchors" looked like a defect) does not translate to the
framework — it lacks the naturalness criterion and quadratic
divergences that make small ratios "problematic" in SM. The
re-audit of the five obstructions per
`vocabulary_is_the_work_pattern.md` Consequence 1 is **done**
(`anchor_count_reaudit.md`): **none open** — #5 rigorous/load-
bearing, #1=#2 Feature (prime-5 absence), #3 argued, #4
dissolved; an instance of the Basepoint Principle.

## Active multi-session derivations (2026-04-25)

After the "honest landing loop" finding (`klein_bridge_audit_and_probe.md`)
that single-session probes converge on Class 4-mechanism / Class 2-
parameters by construction, the framework's active derivation work
shifted to multi-session structural derivations.

### Closed in 2026-04 round

| Region | Closure status | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| **D — Sector decoupling** | **Closed** (D.3 → Class 5; D.1 → Class 5) | Anchor obstruction #5 STRUCTURALLY CLOSED via K=1 vs K<1 non-smooth separation; Klein π_1 sector assignment forced by Z_2 rep machinery. See `path_closures_iter3.md`, `path_closures_iter4.md`. |
| **Ω_b (α, β) closure** | **Closed (Tier 1+2)** | Sign-rep no-EM forces w_- = 1; (α, β) = (0, 1) structurally derived; one-parameter w_+ closure to 0.13%. See `omega_b_alpha_beta_closure.md`. |
| **Partition logit form** | **Closed (vocabulary)** | Logit transformation exposes universal q_2 factor in all three sector complements; Λ:DM:b complement integers are 6, 14, 18 = q_2·{q_3, |F_4|, q_3²}. See `partition_logit_form.md`. |
| **Cross-ratio irrep reframe** | **Closed (reframe)** | Multi-candidate ansatz pattern reframed as PSL(2,ℤ) irrep multiplicity; the three w_+ candidates 13/14, 12/13, 14/15 are distinct PSL(2,ℤ) orbits. See `cross_ratio_irrep_reframe.md`. |
| **Direction 4 — PSL(2,ℤ)-subgroup** | **Phase A+B closed; Phase C open** | Γ_0(6) identified as the substrate-preserved subgroup; cusp index = gcd(denom, INTERACT) maps each w_+ candidate to a framework sector; w_+ inhabits cusp 1/2 (q_2 sector) → 13/14. Phase C representative-selection within cusp orbit remains open. See `psl2z_subgroup_phase_a_results.md`, `psl2z_subgroup_phase_b.md`. |

### Currently active

(none — Direction 4 closed, Region C closed)

### Closed in 2026-04-26 second round (Direction 4 Phase C closure)

| Closure | Outcome |
|---|---|
| **L1 (substrate cusp-1/2 ground state)** | **Class 5 closure in recognize mode** per `L1_substrate_cusp_ground_state.md`. Composes MOND smooth crossover (a0_threshold.md) + EM lock-in (baryon_fraction.md) + substrate discreteness (denomination_boundary.md §134) + local linearity. The "soft boundary needs discrete rulers" picture: substrate's grain IS the operational apparatus for the smooth MOND threshold; closest-discrete-to-continuum-min is forced because substrate has no continuum states. |
| **THM (w_+ = 13/14)** | **Class 5 closure** by composition of T1-T7 + L1 per `w_plus_formalization.md`. Ω_b two-component closure becomes fully derived with no remaining empirical parameter at closure level. |

### Closed in 2026-04-26 (Region C Phase B)

| Region | Closure status | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| **C — Numerology count** | **Closed: PIGEONHOLE** | Per `numerology_count_phase_b.md`: at α=0.05, framework's near-match cloud is statistically consistent with permutation null at all three thresholds (0.1%, 1%, 3%). Honest-landing-loop verdict confirmed. Discriminator is calibrated correctly; further near-match ansatz closure attempts will land Class 2 by construction. |

### Closed in 2026-06 (Substrate-chirality + Torus + Methodology refinements)

| Closure | Outcome |
|---|---|
| **Substrate-chirality disposition** (PR #211, #214) | Three-layer closure: apparatus-extension declined by empirical ℍ-QM exclusion; vocabulary-bridge closed at path δ' (substrate-forced doublet/singlet, observation-fixed L/R labeling); 7th basepoint-principle instance (L vs R orientation). Substrate forces the kinematic structure SM chirality uses; framework neither forces nor needs to derive parity-violation direction. Promoted to Survives. |
| **Mihailescu connection** (PR #214) | The cube identity is the Catalan equation case `(p, q) = (2, 3)`; Mihailescu's theorem (2002) provides deepest-available number-theoretic forcing of `(q_2, q_3) = (2, 3)`. Cube identity alone (without coupled q_2² − 1 = q_3 identity) substrate-forces (q_2, q_3). Strengthens the foundation under all downstream apparatus. Promoted to Survives. |
| **Surface-uniqueness audit** (PR #215) | Klein-bottle uniqueness claim decomposes per possibility-discipline: RP² structurally declined (apparatus inoperative — parabola's two roots identified + no propagating modes); K² vs T² is observation-fixed Z₂-torsor (fermion existence + Ω_Λ match select K² from substrate-admitted pair). Candidate **8th basepoint-principle instance** at the surface-selection layer. See `surface_uniqueness_audit.md`. |
| **Torus-branch arc** (Task 106 closed, PR #215) | Closed at substantive vocabulary clarification level. The Z_6 mode lattice has natural torus T² = Z_2 × Z_3 geometric realization with toroidal direction (q_3 cycle) ↔ SU(3) color and poloidal direction (q_2 cycle) ↔ SU(2) weak — substrate-supported via gauge_sector_lovelock.md's Cartan chain. Unifies four previously-separate framings (Z_6 algebra + X_0(6) cusps + Klein-antipodal action + coprime-to-6 boundary count) in single geometric picture. No new substrate-forced predictions; resolution-mode throughout. Toroidal/poloidal labels are convention-only (parallel to L vs R labeling). |
| **Continuum-limits disposition note** (PR #215) | K=1 is substrate-admitted as a *physically-realized parent regime* rather than purely a mathematical limit. Our K<1 substrate is then a "pocket" coupled to the K=1 "medium" via boundary phenomena (partial-locking at w*, substrate→tree regime change, cosmological horizon at finite mode count). Anchors (H_0, v_EW) become torque transferred from medium to pocket rather than basepoint-of-scale alone. Substrate-admitted, NOT substrate-forced; the existing K=1 → Einstein and K<1 → Schrödinger derivations are unchanged. Disposition note in `continuum_limits.md`. |
| **First methodology candidate: layer-invariant primitives vs layer-specific addresses** (PR #215) | Proposes distinction between framework objects that recur at every layer of any possibly-recursive pocket-medium hierarchy (four primitives, cube identity, Mihailescu-forced (q_2, q_3), XOR rule, Z_6 lattice, φ(6) = 2 boundary structure) and framework objects whose values are derived for our layer (K_STAR, depth 5.83, mode count 12.66, w*, R = 6·13⁵⁴, Ω_Λ, anchors). Substrate-admitted, NOT substrate-forced. First candidate of its kind; two substantive layer-invariant tests provided by torus iter 2 steps 1-2 (gauge sector + Γ_0(6) cusp structure). Four sealing criteria named. See `primitives_vs_addresses_candidate.md`. |
| **Possibility-discipline vocabulary** (PR #214) | Refined `canonical_glossary.md` Section 8 with six entries codifying the substrate-forced / substrate-admitted / structurally-declined / operationally-open four-status discriminator: possibility-discipline (meta-distinction), substrate-forced, substrate-admitted, resolution vs reconstruction (methodology constraint — reconstruction is empirically barred via ℍ-QM exclusion), self-consistency (field-equation) distinct from observation-inversion, productive null / substrate-admitted-with-cluster. Chirality entry added to Section 10 (imported framings NOT translated). Methodology memory `feedback_resolution_vs_reconstruction.md` saved. |
| **Figure-8 necessitation audit** (PR #214) | Audited `figure_eight.md`'s claim that figure-8 is "the structure" against the basepoint-principle's "what would change?" forcing test. Verdict: **CLASS 2** (re-description, not substrate-forced). Three alternative organizations (disjoint loops, K_4, directed graph) preserve substrate apparatus without the figure-8 interpretation. What survives: 4-mode structure, 2-family split, D-uniqueness, Klein-bottle Z_2 antipodal placement, C/P/T symmetries. The "chirality = loop orientation" reading is Class 2 interpretive overlay (eliminating vocabulary-bridge path β). |

## Usage

Adding a new framework prediction? Check this map first. If the
item is in "Fails" or "Eliminated," do not derive again — consult
the listed disproof file for context.

Promoting an item up a category requires satisfying its upgrade
criterion (for Proposed) or the criteria listed in
`numerology_inventory.md` for the stronger retraction classes.

Moving an item down a category requires an explicit finding with a
committed derivation / audit.
