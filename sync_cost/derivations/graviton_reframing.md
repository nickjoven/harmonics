## The problem with "a spin-2 force-carrier particle"

The textbook narrative gives the graviton a stack of primitive
properties: it is a particle (a quantum of a field), it has spin 2,
it is massless, it travels at `c`, and it couples universally to
the stress-energy tensor `T_μν`. Read literally, this is a special
object posited to *mediate* a force by exchange — a mid-20th-century
ontology in which every interaction is carried by a quantized
particle.

The framework does not posit that object. Derivation 13
(`einstein_from_kuramoto.md`) produces the Einstein field equations
`G_μν + Λg_μν = 8πG T_μν` as the *unique* K = 1 continuum output
(Lovelock 1971), with the spacetime metric

    ds² = −N² dt² + γ_ij (dx^i + β^i dt)(dx^j + β^j dt)

built from the coherence tensor `γ_ij = C_ij/C_0 = δ_ij −
⟨∂_i θ ∂_j θ⟩` (`adm_dictionary.md` Part I). Gravity is the
**locked-state geometry of the coherence metric**, not a force
carried by an exchanged particle. Its radiative degree of freedom
is a *fluctuation of that geometry* — a classical wave, already in
the corpus as "synchronization-cost fluctuations of the locked
state" (`spectral_tilt.md`).

This document reframes gravity's radiative mode the way
`photon_reframing.md` reframes light (the Ø-mode, not a carrier) and
`higgs_reframing.md` reframes mass (one locked mode, not a
mass-giver). **The primary object is the tensor mode of `γ_ij`.
"Graviton" is the shadow that mode casts when read through the
force-carrier ontology — and the framework does not adopt that
ontology.**

## What the object is

**The framework's object is the spin-2 transverse-traceless tensor
mode `h_ij` of the coherence metric `γ_ij` about the locked K=1
background.** Write the metric as background plus fluctuation,

    γ_ij = γ_ij^(0) + h_ij,        h_ij = δ(C_ij/C_0)|_TT,

where `h_ij` is the transverse-traceless part of the perturbation of
the coherence tensor `C_ij = δ_ij − ⟨∂_i θ ∂_j θ⟩`. This is a
**classical** substrate fluctuation — fully framework-native, the
radiative degree of freedom of the K=1 locked geometry. It is the
unique spin-2 mode of the substrate: `γ_ij` is the only symmetric
rank-2 tensor constructible from the phase field and its first
derivatives (`adm_dictionary.md` Part I uniqueness argument), so its
transverse-traceless fluctuation is the unique spin-2 propagating
mode. `spectral_tilt.md` already treats these fluctuations as
classical gravitational waves; this doc names the mode and declines
to posit its quantum.

## The precise statement

**Gravity's radiative degree of freedom is the transverse-traceless
tensor mode `h_ij` of the coherence metric `γ_ij = C_ij/C_0` at K=1
— a classical substrate fluctuation. "Spin-2 massless force carrier"
is the coarse-grained shadow, with each clause a property of the
mode, not of a posited particle:**

| Stated graviton property | Framework term (property of `h_ij`) | Forced by |
|---|---|---|
| **Spin-2** | the symmetric rank-2 tensor character of `h_ij` | `γ_ij` is the unique symmetric rank-2 tensor from the phase field (`adm_dictionary.md` Part I) |
| **Two polarizations (TT)** | the transverse-traceless part of `δC_ij` | linearized-Einstein gauge structure, inherited from D13 general covariance (premise d) |
| **Masslessness** | no compact-`K` (`SO(2)`) eigenfrequency — `h_ij` is a coherence-correlation fluctuation, not an oscillator | absence of a compact-part eigenvalue, identical to the photon's masslessness (`speed_of_light.md`, `photon_reframing.md`) |
| **Propagation at `c`** | the locked-state wave operator on `γ_ij` is the K=1 continuum d'Alembertian | the K=1 continuum limit *is* the Einstein equations (`einstein_from_kuramoto.md`, Lovelock 1971); waves propagate at the gate speed `c = N₊` scale |
| **Universal coupling to `T_μν`** | the source term `8πG T_μν` of the unique D13 field equation | Lovelock 1971 uniqueness on the locked sector (`einstein_from_kuramoto.md` Part II) |
| **Self-interaction (nonlinearity)** | `γ_ij` quadratic in `∂θ` ⟹ `h_ij` self-couples through `C_ij` | the coherence tensor is bilinear in phase gradients (`adm_dictionary.md`) |
| **"Force carrier" / mediated exchange** | dissolved — gravity is the locked-state geometry; `h_ij` is the propagating ripple of that geometry, not a quantum exchanged on a background | the metric is the coherence correlation, not a field on a background (D13) |

The "force carrier" clause is the one most sharpened here, and it is
where the last-century baggage lives. The framework has no force
mediated by an exchanged particle; it has a coherence geometry whose
fluctuations propagate classically. **What the textbook calls "the
graviton" presupposes that this classical mode has been quantized
into an exchange particle — a step the framework neither takes nor
requires.**

## What this does not derive — the honest residual

This is a reframing, not a new prediction, and its residual is
sharper than the others in the series:

- The framework supplies the **classical** tensor mode `h_ij` (the
  radiative degree of freedom) and the unique classical dynamics
  (Einstein, via D13). It does **not** quantize that mode. There is
  no construction of "the graviton" as a quantum particle — no
  scattering amplitudes, no loop corrections, no UV completion, and
  **no claim that the framework needs such a construction**. The
  word "graviton" is retained here only to name the textbook concept
  being reframed; the framework's object is the classical mode.
  **This is the honest residual**: the quantization of `h_ij` is
  open, exactly parallel to `photon_reframing.md` leaving the
  numerical value of `c` open. The difference from the photon case
  is that the photon's *classical* object (the Ø-mode) carries the
  full reframing weight; here too the *classical* object (`h_ij`)
  is what is derived, and the quantum is what is declined.
- It introduces **no new framework integer and no new O(1) factor**
  (Z2 vacuously satisfied — no numerical claim; C-structural, not
  C-numerical per `statistical_conventions.md`).
- It changes **no entry in MANIFEST.yml**. No scorecard row added or
  modified. `Λ` and `G` remain anchor-side per the two-anchor
  minimality (`anchor_count_reaudit.md`); the absolute scale (Planck
  mass in kg) stays out of class.

## What this changes in the framework's writeups

After this document, avoid in the framework's own voice:

- "The graviton is a spin-2 force carrier" (as a framework object).
- "Gravity is mediated by graviton exchange."
- "The framework predicts the graviton" (it does not — it has the
  classical mode, not the quantum).

Preferred alternatives:

- "Gravity's radiative degree of freedom is the transverse-traceless
  tensor mode `h_ij` of the coherence metric `γ_ij` at K=1."
- "Gravity is the locked-state geometry of the coherence metric; its
  waves are classical fluctuations of that geometry, not exchanged
  particles."
- "The tensor mode is massless for the same reason the photon's
  Ø-mode is — no compact-`K` eigenfrequency; it is a correlation
  fluctuation, not an oscillator."
- When the quantum is meant: "the quantum of `h_ij` — which the
  framework does not construct — is what the Standard Model calls
  the graviton."

The numerical predictions are unchanged. What changes is the
ontology: the framework's object is the classical spin-2 mode of the
coherence metric; "the graviton" is the force-carrier shadow that
mode casts, and the framework keeps the mode while declining the
quantized particle.

## Distinct from the photon (Ø-mode vs tensor mode)

The photon (`photon_reframing.md`) is the **Ø-mode**: the nilpotent
radical `ℝ·N₊ ⊂ sl(2,R)`, a *null direction* (rank-1, the gate
front). Gravity's radiative mode is the **tensor mode** of `γ_ij`: a
symmetric rank-2 fluctuation of the locked geometry. Both are
classical substrate objects; both are massless for the same
structural reason (no compact-`K` eigenfrequency); both propagate at
`c`. But they are different objects — Ø is the propagation direction
itself; `h_ij` is a fluctuation of the metric *through which*
propagation happens. And the reframings differ in what they decline:
the photon doc declines the numerical value of `c`; this doc
declines the *quantization* of the mode (the "graviton" as a
particle). In both, what is kept is classical and structural; what
is declined is named, not hidden.

## Status

**Reframing.** Sibling of `photon_reframing.md`, `higgs_reframing.md`,
and `spectral_tilt_reframed.md`: a structural/ontological sharpening
that retains all numerical content of its parent derivation
(`einstein_from_kuramoto.md`, D13) and changes only the language and
the primary object. C-structural per `statistical_conventions.md`;
not C-numerical; not registered in the MANIFEST scorecard.

Gravity's radiative degree of freedom is **identified** at the
ontological level: it is uniquely the classical transverse-traceless
tensor mode `h_ij` of the coherence metric `γ_ij` (there was never a
"which mode" question). The **quantization** of that mode — the
"graviton" as a quantum particle — is **not** constructed and is
**not** required as a framework primitive; it is the honest open
residual, parallel to the numerical value of `c` for the photon.
Absolute `G`/Planck-mass scale stays anchor-side / out of class.

## One-line summary

Gravity's radiative degree of freedom is the classical
transverse-traceless tensor mode `h_ij` of the coherence metric
`γ_ij = C_ij/C_0` at K=1 — uniquely identified (no "which mode"
question), massless for the photon's reason (no compact-`K`
eigenfrequency), propagating at `c` because K=1 *is* Einstein. The
framework keeps the classical mode and declines the quantized
"graviton" particle — that quantization is the honest residual,
named not hidden, and the force-carrier ontology is last-century
baggage the framework does not adopt.
