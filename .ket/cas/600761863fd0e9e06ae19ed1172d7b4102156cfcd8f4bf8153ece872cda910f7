## What this file is

A focused record of attempting Shape A.1 from
`remaining_gap_shapes.md` — closing the 11% A_s Floor residual
via the largest identified gap G1 (horizon-crossing
amplification) per `a_s_geometric_proof.md`.

Both natural variants of G1 (G1.α: framework-native H_inf
analog; G1.β: direct dimensionless reduction without H_inf)
encounter the **same structural barrier** as path (a): the
required ingredient (H_inf or framework-native ε) is anchor-
side, not substrate-side. This is the seventh instance of the
`vocabulary_is_the_work_pattern.md` disambiguation pattern.

The attempt closes with a reframe: **A_s = 2.33e-9 is the
framework's *complete* substrate-side prediction; the 11%
residual is the inflation-amplification gap, which is
fundamentally anchor-side and not closeable framework-natively
without importing H_inf or equivalent.** The Floor entry in
`framework_status.md` should be re-tagged accordingly.

## What was attempted

The current proof gives `A_s_static = (1−φ⁻⁴)/(4·λ_unlock·φ·q²)`
= 2.328e-9. The 11% gap to observation (2.10e-9) was attributed
in the proof's §G1 to horizon-crossing amplification — each
mode picks up `(H_inf/2π)²` in standard inflation; this factor
is missing from the framework's static computation.

To close G1, we need to derive a dimensionless function f such
that `A_s = f · A_s_static` and f comes from a structural
operation, not a fit. Two paths (per
`a_s_geometric_proof.md` §G1):

- **G1.α**: derive a framework-native H_inf analog. Use
  standard `A_s = (1/(8π²))(H/M_P)²/(ε·c_s)` and supply
  `(H_inf/M_P)²` from framework structure.
- **G1.β**: bypass H_inf; derive ε framework-natively from a
  source other than observed n_s, then evaluate the standard
  formula's structure with framework inputs only.

Both paths were tested numerically.

## G1.α numerical findings

**Required**: `(H_inf/M_P)² ≈ 1.083 × 10⁻⁹` to produce A_s_obs
via standard slow-roll.

**Framework-native candidates**:

| Candidate | (H/M_P)² | Ratio to target |
|---|---|---|
| `(1−φ⁻⁴)/(4φ·q_pivot²)` | 1.10e-9 | **1.017** (1.7% off) |
| `c_s²/q_pivot²` | 1.16e-9 | 1.067 |
| `(1−φ⁻⁴)/(6·q_pivot²)` | 1.19e-9 | 1.097 |
| `1/(φ·q_pivot²)` | 5.16e-9 | 4.76 |
| `1/q_pivot²` | 8.35e-9 | 7.71 |
| `λ²_unlock` | 0.224 | 2 × 10⁸ |
| `1/(2π·q_pivot)²` | 2.11e-10 | 0.20 |

The leading match `(1−φ⁻⁴)/(4φ·q²)` lands within 2% — striking
numerically. But it is also exactly the ansatz pattern flagged
in `ansatz_audit_policy.md`: multiple framework-integer
expressions match within tens of percent, no single expression
is forced by structural argument. Per the K_STAR^14 = 1/8
demotion (commit `b8911fb`), this category of match is Class 2
unless a forcing argument is supplied.

**Forcing argument attempted**: identify `(H_inf/M_P)²` as the
*static phase variance times Stern-Brocot RG factor*,
equivalently `⟨δθ²⟩_bracket · (1−φ⁻⁴)`. This would give the
match exactly. But there is **no framework-internal reason**
for the (1−φ⁻⁴) RG factor to multiply the static variance to
produce H_inf — the RG factor is from the spatial diffusion
fixed point (A6), not from inflationary dynamics. The
identification is post-hoc.

## G1.β numerical findings

**Required**: ε ≈ 0.0175 (from observed n_s = 0.965 via
slow-roll consistency).

**Framework-internal ε candidates** (avoiding observed n_s):

| Candidate | ε value | Ratio to target |
|---|---|---|
| `1/(√5·n_pivot)` | 0.0224 | 1.27 |
| `λ_unlock/n_pivot` | 0.0237 | 1.35 |
| `1/n_pivot` (Fibonacci depth) | 0.05 | 2.85 |
| `φ⁻⁶` | 0.0557 | 3.18 |
| `φ⁻⁵` | 0.0902 | 5.14 |
| `λ²·(1−φ⁻⁴)` | 0.191 | 10.9 |

Closest two candidates (`1/(√5·n_pivot)` and `λ/n_pivot`) are
~30% off the target. None forced.

**Deeper structural barrier**. The framework's existing rate
parameter (A9.1) is `rate = (1−n_s)/ln(φ²)`. This is a
**consistency relation** — it tells us rate IF we know n_s. It
does not predict n_s framework-natively. Per
`numerology_inventory.md` Class 2 entry on N_efolds = √5/rate,
the same-form expressions inherit the n_s dependence and are
not framework-native predictions.

For ε to be framework-native, the framework needs an internal
N_efolds prediction. None exists: the conversion from "1
Fibonacci depth" to "1 e-fold" requires an absolute time
anchor (anchor-count obstruction #3, `h_inf_status.md`).

## The shared barrier

Both G1.α and G1.β require an **anchor-side ingredient** that
the framework does not natively supply:

- G1.α: `(H_inf/M_P)²` requires absolute Hubble during inflation
  (anchor obstruction #3).
- G1.β: framework-native ε requires conversion from Fibonacci
  depth to e-folds (anchor obstruction #3, equivalently #4).

Per `dynamical_tool_audit.md`: the framework's substrate is
algebraic (Klein-Z₂ rep, Stern-Brocot mediants, z₀-stratification),
not temporal. There is no internal "Hubble" until an anchor
provides the conversion to physical time. This is a feature of
the framework's substrate-side discipline, not a deficiency.

## Reframe per the vocabulary-is-the-work pattern

The "G1 horizon-crossing amplification gap" was framed in
`a_s_geometric_proof.md` as a structural derivation gap to be
closed. Following the disambiguation pattern (per
`vocabulary_is_the_work_pattern.md`), this framing imports
inflation-amplification vocabulary that maps to anchor-side
structure in the framework, not substrate-side.

**Disambiguated reading**: A_s decomposes into two pieces:

1. **Substrate-side static variance**: `A_s_static =
   (1−φ⁻⁴)/(4·λ_unlock·φ·q_pivot²)` = 2.33e-9. This is
   framework-derived from A1-A9 with no fitted factors. It is
   the framework's complete substrate-side prediction.

2. **Anchor-side amplification factor** `f_amp ≈ 0.901`.
   Standard inflation supplies this via `(H_inf/M_P)²/(8π²·ε·c_s)`,
   where H_inf and ε are anchor-side (require H_0 conversion).
   The framework cannot derive `f_amp` without importing the
   cosmological anchor.

The 11% residual is the **anchor-side amplification factor
projected onto the framework's substrate-side prediction**. It
is not a gap in the framework's derivation; it is the framework
making a different statement than full inflationary cosmology
makes.

## What this is and is not

**This is**: a clean structural finding. The framework's A_s
prediction is the substrate-side static variance; the inflation-
amplification correction lives anchor-side. The 11% reflects
the framework's (correct, disciplined) refusal to import anchor
content into substrate derivations.

**This is not**: a claim that A_s = 2.33e-9 is the observable.
The observable A_s = 2.10e-9 is the inflation-amplified value;
the framework simply doesn't compute the amplification, and
this is a category statement, not a derivation failure.

**This is not**: a permanent verdict. If the framework develops
a substrate-side derivation of inflationary dynamics — e.g., by
deriving a framework-native conversion from Fibonacci depth to
e-folds without anchor input — G1 closure becomes possible. But
that is a substantial structural addition, not a one-session
audit.

## Framework status update

Per the disambiguation, the A_s entry in `framework_status.md`
should be re-tagged:

**Current** ("Floor structural residual at finite Fibonacci
depth, 7-11%"):
> A_s | 11% / 7.7σ | a_s_geometric_proof.md
> Closure requires either framework-native fractional-weight
> mechanism, observational revision, or a structural rule
> change.

**Recommended** (after this attempt):
> A_s | substrate-side static prediction: 2.33e-9
> | observed (anchor-amplified): 2.10e-9
> | gap (11%) is anchor-side amplification per
>   `a_s_g1_closure_attempt.md`
> | framework-native closure requires substrate-side inflation
>   derivation (not currently scoped)

This parallels the v/M_P entry's revised reading per
`path_a_walkthrough.md` and the SM-hierarchy non-translation
per `hierarchy_problem_translation.md`.

## Connection to remaining gap shapes

This finding affects multiple shapes:

- **Shape A.1 (A_s)** — closure attempt complete, lands as
  category statement (anchor-side amplification not framework-
  scoped). Same as path (a) closure pattern.

- **Shape A.2-3 (Ω_b, Ω_c/Ω_b)** — likely follow same pattern
  if their residuals also depend on inflationary or anchor-side
  amplifications. Worth checking; could be a single audit pass
  through Shape A.

- **Shape D (cross-sector v/M_P)** — already closed via path
  (a). The A_s finding generalizes: the framework's substrate
  derivations and observation can differ by anchor-side
  amplifications without that being a framework deficiency.

## What would change this

The attempt would re-open if any of:

1. **Substrate-side inflation derivation**. Construct a
   framework-native derivation of the inflationary phase from
   primitive operations (mediant, parabola, fixed-point) without
   anchor input. The k-Ω map (`k_omega_mapping.py`) would need
   to extend to a "depth → time" map without H_0.

2. **Forcing argument for `(H/M_P)² = (1−φ⁻⁴)/(4φ·q²)`**.
   Specifically: a structural reason the static phase variance
   times Stern-Brocot RG equals the inflationary Hubble squared.
   The 1.7% match is suggestive; a derivation would flip the
   verdict from Class 2 to Class 4.

3. **Framework-native ε from a non-anchor source**. The closest
   candidates (1/(√5·n_pivot), λ/n_pivot) are within ~30%; if
   one is forced from substrate structure, both ε and rate
   become framework-native.

Without one of these, A_s 11% is the framework's category
statement, not a closeable gap.

## Status

**A_s closure: ACCEPTED as Instance 7 of
`vocabulary_is_the_work_pattern.md` (2026-04-26).** The
substrate-side prediction A_s_substrate = 2.33×10⁻⁹ is the
framework's complete native claim; the 11% gap to A_s_obs =
2.10×10⁻⁹ is the inflation amplification factor f_amp,
anchor-side (depends on H_inf + ε). Framework correctly declines
to predict both A_s_obs and f_amp magnitude.

Class: Survives (substrate-side prediction; promoted from Floor
to Survives in `framework_status.md`).

Side: substrate-side (A_s_substrate); anchor-side (A_s_obs and
f_amp).

Same structural shape as v/M_P closure (Path (a)) and
lattice-QCD bare-vs-renormalized distinction. Reopens only if
the framework develops a substrate-side inflation derivation
(reading b: extension, not gap closure).
